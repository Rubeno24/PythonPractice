Git Clone 
    git clone https://name-of-the-repository-link
        Copies code from a remote repo to your local machine

Git Branch
Allows developers to create branches to work on feature or bug fixes and eventually merge their branches to the main branch
    git branch branch_name
        Create a new local branch

    git branch -d branch_name
        Deletes a branch
    
    git checkout branch_name
        switch to another branch
    
    git checkout -b branch_name
        create a new branch and switch to it

Git Status 
    git status 
        Gives information about a branch, what files are created deleted, what needs to be staged or unstaged
        If there is anything to commit, push or pull
        Or if the branch is up to date

Git Add
    git add 
        How we include files in our next commit
    git add --all
        include all files that were modified in the next commit

Git Commit 
    git commit -m "Short message explaining what you devloped"
        Its like taking a screenshot of your code a certain point in time
        Getting them ready to be pushed to the repository

Git Push
    git push remote_branch branch_name
        git push origin main
            Be careful pushing to the main branch if you are working on a team
            By default the main branch of a remote repository is named main
            So pushing to main may delete the work that was there already
        git push origin feature_branch
            This will push your feature branch to a remote repository but not overide main
            It will push to your feature branch or create one if neccessary

Git pull
    git pull origin main
        Fetches updates from a remote repo from the specfied branch in this case main and applies them to your branch
        This may casue local merge conflicts if someone else worked on something you worked on localy
